I have written a sms spam detection using naive bayes algorithm.
Steps:
1.Remove punchuation and stop words also if you want you can perform stemming.
2.Use CountVectorizer and genrate Vocablary and then genrate bag of words.
3.Use TF-IDF Transformer to normalize bag of words.
4.Prepare train,test data.
5.Train the Multinomial naive bayes Classifier using test data.
6.Test the model using test data.
