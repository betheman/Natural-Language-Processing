# spam_detection using  naive bayes Multinomial classifier

I have created a SMS spam detection model using a naive Bayes algorithm. 

steps:

1. Remove punctuation and stop words also if you want you can perform stemming. 

2. Use CountVectorizer and generate Vocabulary and then generate a bag of words. 

3. Use TF-IDF Transformer to normalize bag of words. 

4. Prepare train, test data.

5. Train the Multinomial naive bayes Classifier using test data 6. Test the model using test data

I have created a SMS spam detection model using a bayes theoram. 

steps:

1. Remove punctuation and stop words.

2. Performed stemming.

3. Created bag of words. 
 
4. Prepare train, test data.

5. calculated conditional probability of each word.
